# Q-BnB - Vacation Booking Platform

## Overview
A dynamic website, similar to Airbnb, allowing users to securely login, book, create and update listings for places where they can stay. The backend component focuses on the functionality of components such as password creation, while the frontend handles user input and listing management. User data such as login information, listing creating and bookings is stored in a database allowing them to manage their stay options. Thorough testing was done to ensure the efficient functionality of all components and features.
