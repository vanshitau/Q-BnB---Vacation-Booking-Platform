Amanda (Scrum Master)
1. branch `frontend-register`
2. Implemented Selenium and given front-end code from CISC327 github. Input converage, functionality converage is working.
3. Output coverage isn't working. Loggin in is failing for some reason.
4. Collaborate with team and reach out to professor or TAs if needed for help if I can't resolve this myself over the next few days. All PRs are to be finished by Thurs night so I can resolve merge conflicts.


Bilal
1. branch `create_listing_test`
2. input converage, functionality converage working.
3. Output coverage isn't working. Passing test case for output coverage not working
4. Review code from previous sprint to make sure there is no issues causing the output to fail. If I still not figure it out, I will consult my team and/or prof/TA's


Keenan
1. branch `frontend-testing`
2. Currently, I have written test cases for the update listing function, listing the title and the description.
3. I am struggling with the test cases for functionality testing. I am unsure how to implement the testing for this type of black box testing.
4. For the next few days, I will talk with my group to work together to figure out how to implement functionality testing and finish my test cases.


Vanshita
1. branch `user-frontend`
2. Input coverage and functionality coverage test cases pass.
3. Output coverage does not work -- it gives a server error at the end.
4. Continue to work on the test cases and reach out to the TAs, professor and other team members if help is needed.
